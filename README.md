# Deep-Learning-Algorithm-and-Spark
The goal of this project is to get you familiar with the MapReduce programming model using the Apache Spark framework. In the first part you will optimize convolutional neural networks(CNN), a sort of the deep learning algorithms, with the MapReduce framework. In the second part of the project, you will run your implementation on a large cluster of Amazon Web Services Elastic Compute Cloud (AWS EC2) servers in order to crunch through a large problem. We hope that by doing this project you will gain an appreciation for the MapReduce programming model, and at the same time pick up a very marketable skill.
