# Deep-Learning-Algorithm-and-Spark
The goal of this project was to get familiar using the MapReduce programming model using the Apache Spark framework. In the first part my partner and I optimized a convolutional neural networks(CNN), a sort of the deep learning algorithms, with the MapReduce framework. In the second part of the project, we ran your implementation on a large cluster of Amazon Web Services Elastic Compute Cloud (AWS EC2) servers in order to crunch through a large problem. We hoped that by doing this, we would gain an appreciation for the MapReduce programming model, and at the same time pick up a very marketable skill.
